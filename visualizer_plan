Vision: Real-time visual feedback for meditation practice

Conditions:
- Record signals via OpenBCI
- Transform signals into visual
		- Trained NN translates incoming signals into a transformed output
				- An API protocol is established between EEG device and trained neural network
				- There exists a trained nn that is able to receive and transform data through API port
						- There is a nn trained on signal 
				- Trained NN is able to output transformed signal to display API port
		- Display protocol takes transformed output and displays it

- Work Plan:
		- Find research on EEG signal processing
				- Answer: what can I do with this? 
		- Develop basic display protocol:
				- Summary Statistics:
						- FFT
				- Live graphs
		- Develop a trained Recurrent NN that takes in a signal and outputs it
				- Identify Auto-encoder architectures for time-series NN's
				- Identify time-series transformation techniques (Fourier Visualizer)
		- Develop a visualizer for time-series data
		- Connect trained Recurrent NN and visualizer

- Prototype I: Take incoming signal, display transformed signal statistics
- Prototype II: Take incoming signal, auto-encode
